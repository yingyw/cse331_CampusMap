# This test file confirms that working well on two or more edges
# Between two nodes
# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes 
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge 1.100 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge 1.200 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge 1.300 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge 1.400 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge 1.500 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge 1.600 from n3 to n4 in graph1
added edge 1.700 from n4 to n3 in graph1

# List the nodes in graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3 n4
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(1.100) n2(1.200) n2(1.300) 
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n3(1.400) n3(1.500)
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n4(1.600)
the children of n4 in graph1 are: n3(1.700)
