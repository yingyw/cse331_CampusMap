#Test add edges to graph, each node as start point at least one time
#and as end point for at least one time.
# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add many of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1
added node n5 to graph1

# Add many edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e13 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge e24 from n2 to n4 in graph1
added edge e3 from n3 to n4 in graph1
added edge e4 from n4 to n5 in graph1
added edge e5 from n5 to n1 in graph1
